- 👋 Hi, I’m @nakul-gupta
- 👀 I’m interested in DeFi, Web3, NFTs, Social Tokens, Token Engineering and Decentralization!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics and autonomous sytems at USC (grad school), with hopes of applying methodologies from these fields into the 
      design of robust tokenomic systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any decentralization/web3/NFT project, especially in the music/Djing/electronic music production space
